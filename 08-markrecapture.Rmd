# Mark-Recapture

A concept that comes up not only in this class, but in Biology and future WFC classes, is mark-recapture. Mark-recapture is a great method of estimating the population of a species in an area. Obviously, it is difficult, well impossible, to count each individual and keep track of them. This is what makes mark-recapture very helpful.

In mark-recapture, you catch individuals from the population and mark them (hence the name). After you mark the individual, you release them. You do this through a period of time, and obviously, during this period, you will be getting individuals that are already marked.

The equation for mark-recapture is:

$\frac{M}{\hat{N}}$ = $\frac{R}{T}$

-   *M* is individuals marked initially
-   $\hat{N}$ is estimated population size
-   *R* is marked recaptured
-   *T* is the total in the next sample

The population size ($\hat{N}$) is typically unknown and what we want to find, and so the equation can be rewritten as:

$\hat{N}$ = $\frac{M*T}{R}$

## Example 

In a sample of 60 mice, you catch and mark 12 mice. The second time you catch mice, you catch 11 mice with 2 being marked.

From the equation we get that:

-   *M* = 12
-   *R* = 2
-   *T* = 11

We plug these into the equation $\frac{M}{\hat{N}}$ = $\frac{R}{T}$ to get:

$\frac{12}{\hat{N}}$ = $\frac{2}{11}$

This formula can be rearranged into:

$\hat{N}$ = $\frac{12*11}{2}$ = 66 estimated population

## Practice 1: Estimating population size

You mark 25 individuals initially. In your second sample of 20, you find 5 marked. What is the estimated population size?

## Mark-Recaptured in R

Things get a bit more complicated in R Studio. It is difficult to take a large data set and count for each individual. In R, we take a data set and utilize table() function.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
my_table<- table(my_data$column_of_interest_1, my_data$column_of_interest_2)

my_table
```

When we run the my_table function, the output will look something like this:

![From Mark-Recapture Lecture](https://github.com/refurrow/wfc70/blob/main/markrecapturetable.png?raw=true)

Where Y = Yes (recapture) and N = No (new individual)

***This is an example. Different data sets will provide a different number of outputs.***

With these outputs, we can enter our mark-recapture data as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_table_M <- c( , ,...,) #marked initially
my_table_T <- c( , ,...,) #total captured
my_table_R <- c( , ,...,) #recaptured
```

Taking the example from the image above, the entered mark-recapture data will look like:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
my_table_M <- c(4, 14)
my_table_T <- c(12, 6)
my_table_R <- c(2, 4)
```

The value of my_table_M are obtained from the first date No column with the second date No column. We do not count the last date. The values of my_table_T are obtained from adding the second and third date being added across. So 10+2=12 and 2+4=6. The values of my_table_R are obtained from the Y column from the second and third date.

After we enter our mark-recapture data, we can enter these into the equation $\hat{N}$ = $\frac{12*11}{2}$ to estimate the population size.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
sum(my_table_M*my_table_T)/sum(my_table_R)
```
