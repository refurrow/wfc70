# Welcome to WFC 70 {-}

The purpose of WFC 70 is to build your data literacy skills, with a focus on using R programming to wrangle, plot, and interpret data. 

This website is a mini-textbook where you can browse the course labs and explore other mini-lessons. Some lessons focus on troubleshooting common mistakes, other on shortcuts for maximum efficiency, and others on more advanced techniques to enable you to take on more complex data sets for your project.

This website was created by WFC 70 Learning Assistants! We hope it is of use :)
